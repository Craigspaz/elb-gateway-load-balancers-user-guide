## Overview<a name="overview"></a>

A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is a VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity between virtual appliances in the service provider VPC, and application servers in the service consumer VPC\. The Gateway Load Balancer is deployed in the same VPC as that of the virtual appliances\. These appliances are registered as a target group of the Gateway Load Balancer\.

The application servers run in one subnet \(destination subnet\) in the service consumer VPC, while the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is in another subnet of the same VPC\. All traffic entering the service consumer VPC through the internet gateway is first routed to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection and then routed to the destination subnet\.

Similarly, all traffic leaving the application servers \(destination subnet\) is routed to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection before it is routed back to the internet\. The following network diagram is a visual representation of how a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is used to access an endpoint service\.

1. Traffic is sent to the Gateway Load Balancer for inspection through the security appliance\.

1.  Traffic is sent back to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint after inspection\. 

1. Traffic is sent to the internet gateway based on the route table configuration\.

1. Traffic is routed back to the internet\.

### Routing<a name="route-tables"></a>

The route table for the internet gateway must have an entry that routes traffic destined for the application servers to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint\. To specify the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, use the ID of the VPC endpoint\. The following example shows the routes for a dualstack configuration\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC IPv4 CIDR | Local | 
| VPC IPv6 CIDR | Local | 
| Subnet 1 IPv4 CIDR | vpc\-endpoint\-id | 
| Subnet 1 IPv6 CIDR | vpc\-endpoint\-id | 

The route table for the subnet with the application servers must have entries that route all traffic from the application servers to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC IPv4 CIDR | Local | 
| VPC IPv6 CIDR | Local | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | vpc\-endpoint\-id | 
| ::/0 | vpc\-endpoint\-id | 

The route table for the subnet with the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint must route traffic that returns from inspection to its final destination\. For traffic that originated from the internet, the local route ensures that it reaches the application servers\. For traffic that originated from the application servers, add entries that route all traffic to the internet gateway\.


| Destination | Target | 
| --- | --- | 
| VPC IPv4 CIDR | Local | 
| VPC IPv6 CIDR | Local | 
| 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | internet\-gateway\-id | 
| ::/0 | internet\-gateway\-id | 

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
+ Ensure that the service consumer VPC has at least two subnets for each Availability Zone that contains application servers\. One subnet is for the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, and the other is for the application servers\.
+ The Gateway Load Balancer and the targets can be in the same subnet\.
+ You cannot use a subnet that is shared from another account to deploy the Gateway Load Balancer\.
+ Launch at least one security appliance instance in each security appliance subnet in the service provider VPC\. The security groups for these instances must allow UDP traffic on port 6081\.

## Step 1: Register targets and create a Gateway Load Balancer<a name="create-register"></a>

Use the following procedure to create your target group, register your security appliance instances as targets, and then create your load balancer and listener\.

**To create a target group and register targets**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **Load Balancing**, choose **Target Groups**\.

1. Choose **Create target group**\.

1. For **Choose a target type**, select **Instances** to specify targets by instance ID, or **IP addresses** to specify targets by IP address\.

1. For **Target group name**, enter a name for your target group\. For example, **my\-targets**\.

1. **Protocol** must be `GENEVE`, and **Port** must be `6081`\. No other protocols or ports are supported\.

1. For **VPC**, select a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) with the instances to include in the target group\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Health checks**, modify the health check settings as needed\.

1. \(Optional\) Expand **Tags** and add tags\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. Add one or more targets as follows:
   + If the target type is **Instances**, select one or more instances, enter one or more ports, and then choose **Include as pending below**\.
   + If the target type is **IP addresses**, select the network, enter the IP address and ports, and then choose **Include as pending below**\.

1. Choose **Create target group**\.

**To create a Gateway Load Balancer**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. For **VPC**, select the service provider VPC\.

1. For **Mappings**, select all of the Availability Zones in which you launched security appliance instances, and the corresponding public subnets\.

1. For **Default action**, select a target group to forward traffic to\. If you don't have a target group, create one first\. The target group must use the GENEVE protocol\.

1. \(Optional\) Expand **Tags** and add tags\.

1. Review your configuration, and then choose **Create load balancer**\.

## Step 2: Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint service<a name="create-endpoint-service"></a>

Use the following procedure to create an endpoint service using a Gateway Load Balancer\.

**To create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint service**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**\.

1. Choose **Create endpoint service** and do the following:

   1. For **Load balancer type**, choose **Gateway**\.

   1. For **Available load balancers**, select your Gateway Load Balancer\.

   1. For **Require acceptance for endpoint**, select **Acceptance required** to accept connection requests to your service manually\. Otherwise, they are automatically accepted\.

   1. For **Supported IP address types**, do one of the following:
      + Select **IPv4** – Enable the endpoint service to accept IPv4 requests\.
      + Select **IPv6** – Enable the endpoint service to accept IPv6 requests\.
      + Select **IPv4** and **IPv6** – Enable the endpoint service to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 requests\.

   1. \(Optional\) To add a tag, choose **Add new tag** and enter the tag key and tag value\.

   1. Choose **Create**\. Note the service name; you'll need it when you create the endpoint\.

1. Select the new endpoint service and choose **Actions**, **Allow principals**\. Enter the ARNs of the service consumers that are allowed to create an endpoint to your service\. A service consumer can be a user, IAM role, or AWS account\. Choose **Allow principals**\.

## Step 3: Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint<a name="create-endpoint"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint\. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are zonal\. We recommend that you create one Gateway Load Balancer endpoint per zone\. For more information, see [Access virtual appliances through AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html) in the *AWS PrivateLink Guide*\.

**To create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**\.

1. Choose **Create endpoint** and do the following:

   1. For **Service category**, choose **Other endpoint services**\.

   1. For **Service name**, enter the service name that you noted earlier, and then choose **Verify service**\.

   1. For **VPC**, select the service consumer VPC\.

   1. For **Subnets**, select a subnet for the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint\.

   1. For **IP address type**, choose from the following options:
      + **IPv4** – Assign IPv4 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces\. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have IPv4 address ranges\.
      + **IPv6** – Assign IPv6 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces\. This option is supported only if all selected subnets are IPv6 only subnets\.
      + **Dualstack** – Assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces\. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges\.

   1. \(Optional\) To add a tag, choose **Add new tag** and enter the tag key and tag value\.
