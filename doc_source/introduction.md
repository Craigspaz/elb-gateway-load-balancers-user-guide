# What is a Gateway Load Balancer?<a name="introduction"></a>

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, in one or more Availability Zones\. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets\. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time\. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads\.

Elastic Load Balancing supports the following load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers\. You can select the type of load balancer that best suits your needs\. This guide discusses Gateway Load Balancers\. For more information about the other load balancers, see the [User Guide for Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/), the [User Guide for Network Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/), and the [User Guide for Classic Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/)\.

## Gateway Load Balancer overview<a name="gateway-load-balancer-overview"></a>

Gateway Load Balancers enable you to deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems\. It combines a transparent network gateway \(that is, a single entry and exit point for all traffic\) and distributes traffic while scaling your virtual appliances with the demand\. 

A Gateway Load Balancer operates at the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection \(OSI\) model, the network layer\. It listens for all IP packets across all ports and forwards traffic to the target group that's specified in the listener rule\. It maintains stickiness of flows to a specific target appliance using 5\-tuple \(for TCP/UDP flows\) or 3\-tuple \(for non\-TCP/UDP flows\)\. The Gateway Load Balancer and its registered virtual appliance instances exchange application traffic using the [GENEVE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8926) protocol on port 6081\.

Gateway Load Balancers use Gateway Load Balancer endpoints to securely exchange traffic across VPC boundaries\. A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is a VPC endpoint that provides private connectivity between virtual appliances in the service provider VPC and application servers in the service consumer VPC\. You deploy the Gateway Load Balancer in the same VPC as the virtual appliances\. You register the virtual appliances with a target group for the Gateway Load Balancer\.

Traffic to and from a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is configured using route tables\. Traffic flows from the service consumer VPC over the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to the Gateway Load Balancer in the service provider VPC, and then returns to the service consumer VPC\. You must create the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint and the application servers in different subnets\. This enables you to configure the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint as the next hop in the route table for the application subnet\.

For more information, see [Access virtual appliances through AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html) in the *AWS PrivateLink Guide*\.

## Appliance vendors<a name="appliance-vendors"></a>

You are responsible for choosing and qualifying software from appliance vendors\. You must trust the appliance software to inspect or modify traffic from the load balancer\. The appliance vendors listed as [Elastic Load Balancing Partners](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/partners/) have integrated and qualified their appliance software with AWS\. You can place a higher degree of trust in the appliance software from vendors in this list\. However, AWS does not guarantee the security or reliability of software from these vendors\.

## Getting started<a name="tutorials"></a>

To create a Gateway Load Balancer using the AWS Management Console, see [Getting started](getting-started.md)\. To create a Gateway Load Balancer using the AWS Command Line Interface, see [Getting started using the CLI](getting-started-cli.md)\.

With your load balancer, you pay only for what you use\. For more information, see [Elastic Load Balancing pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/)\.
